# Quantitative MRI Analysis of Ventricular Enlargement in Schizophrenia

This repository contains a Python-based quantitative MRI analysis pipeline developed to investigate ventricular enlargement in schizophrenia. Using open-access neuroimaging data, ventricular and whole-brain volumes were estimated to compute the ventricular-to-brain volume ratio (VBR).

Statistical analysis revealed a highly significant difference between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls (p = 1.7 × 10⁻⁶), with the patient group showing an approximately 18% increase in VBR. These findings are consistent with established neuroimaging literature and support the relevance of quantitative MRI biomarkers.
